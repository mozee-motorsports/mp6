- [ ] We're going to need to figure out how to link the CPP code for the 
      Adafruit servo library. Can we do this with make? Is this reasonable
      or should we write our own device driver?


Things we need to figure out how they work:
- [ ] STM32 HAL ADC input
- [ ] STM32 HAL PWM output
- [ ] STM32 HAL J1939 Output over CAN
- [ ] kill me this is stupid we need to ship a deliverable
